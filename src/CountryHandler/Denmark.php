     * The CPR office has since 2007 given out social security numbers without the so called modulus 11 control.
     * The social security numbers without modulus 11 are completely valid
     * and are given out, as some birth years no longer have the capacity to provide them with modulus 11 control.
     *
     * We should not check modulus 11 control for the following birthdays:
     *
     * 1st of January 1960
     * 1st of January 1964
     * 1st of January 1965
     * 1st of January 1966
     * 1st of January 1969
     * 1st of January 1970
     * 1st of January 1974
     * 1st of January 1980
     * 1st of January 1982
